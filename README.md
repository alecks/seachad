Seachad is a self-hostable donation site that simply links to other payment gateways and displays cryptocurrency addresses. You're able to:

- serve dynamic donation sites with a YAML config file;
- update info, like targets/progress;
- customise HTML/CSS templates from your browser; and
- generate static pages that can be served on [Netlify](https://netlify.com), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), etc.
